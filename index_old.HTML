        <h1>New York Historical Facts</h1>
        <h2>Fact 1</h2>
        <h3>Used to be called New Amsterdam</h3>
            <section id="facts">
                <p>The Dutch came to Manhattan first and established a colony, New Amsterdam, in the 1620s. Due to the unpopularity of Governor Peter Stuyvesant, however, its inhabitants refused to fight off the English in 1664. Since the Duke of York was leading the mission to capture the island, the colony was renamed in his honour!</p>

        <h2>Fact 2</h2>
        <h3>Popularized bingo</h3>
            <section id="facts">
                <p>The people of New York have always been trendsetters, and travelling salesman Edwin Lowe was no exception. In 1929, Lowe came upon a European game called Beano, which involved beans, number combinations, and hand-stamped cards. Intrigued, he began making his own version to mass-produce. And according to a feature by Foxy Bingo on the game's origins, it was in Lowe's hometown of New York, while he was testing this version with friends, that one of them accidentally cried out, "Bingo!" The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
